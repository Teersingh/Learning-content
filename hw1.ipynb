Vectorization\n","\n","Lists are a foundational data structure in Python, allowing us to create simple and complex algorithms to solve problems.

Through these exercises, we will begin introducing you to how to think more mathematically through the use of NumPy by starting with a process known as vectorization.\n","\n","Index chasing is a very valuable skill, and certainly one you will need in this course, but mathematical problems often have simpler and more efficient representations that use vectors. The process of converting from an implimentation that uses indicies to one that uses vectors is known as vectorization. Once vectorized, the resulting implimentation often yields to the user faster and more readable code than before.\n","\n","In the following problems, we will ask you to practice reading mathematical expressions and deduce their vectorized equivalent along with their implimentation in Python. You will use the NumPy array object as the Python equivalent to a vector, and in later sections you will work with sets of vectors known as matrices.

Tensors are similar to numpy nd-arrays and tensors support most of the functionality that numpy matrices do.\n","\n","In the following exercises, you will familiarize yourself with tensors and more importantly, the PyTorch documentation.
